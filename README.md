<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
<b>First off, the rules for seahaven solitaire are as follows: </b> 
<br />
<br />
1.	The top cards of tableau piles and cards from reserve piles are available to play.<br/>
2.	You may build tableau piles down in suit.<br/>
3.	Only one card at a time can be moved at a time.<br/>
4.	When any of reserve piles are empty you can fill the space with any card<br/>
5.	Each reserve pile may contain only one card.<br/>
6.	You can fill empty tableau piles with a King.<br/>
<br />
<br />
<b>Personally for my implementation, the program executes as follows:</b> 
<br />
<br />
To start the game a tableau generated from a randomized set of cards will appear, along with the empty cells and foundation blocks:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
If the input is a legal move, an updated tableau, cells, and foundation block will appear and the user can input their next move:  <br/>

If an illegal move is passed in, an error message will appear and will re-prompt the user for input:  <br/>
